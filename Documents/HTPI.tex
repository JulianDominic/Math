I wrote these notes principally FOR understanding, they are meant for future reference for a refresher on what I have learnt. These notes assumes a mathematical maturity of at least an A-Level student because there may be some technical aspects that are deemed too difficult to fully comprehend if the reader is not at the required level. \\
Honestly, I don't have much to say, I just thought that a preface would be cool. Let's start our journey now.

\section{Sentential Logic}
\subsection{Deductive reasoning and logical connectives}
In an \textit{argument}, we arrive at \textit{conclusions} assuming that the \textit{premises} are \textbf{true}. \\ 
Premises are often referred to as conditions, and conclusions are called the outcome. \\
If all the premises are \textbf{true}, then the conclusion should be \textbf{true}. However, for the case where the conclusion is \textbf{false} while the premises are \textbf{true}, the argument is \textbf{invalid}.
